There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Selectively Enjoy Next Dinner's Hard Alcohol List Proactively - #SENDHALP

## Sub-Heading ##
  > This app is for everybody that needs assistance when deciding what to eat or drink for the next evening.

## Summary ##
  > When you first visit the site, you will be presented with a suggested meal that is randomly pulled from the database. If you would like to save the meal, you can add it to your "saved" list to access at another time. If you don't like the suggested meal, there will be an option to randomly generate another suggested meal or beverage. You are able to access all your saved meals and beverages in an organized screen with links to each recipe included.

## Problem ##
  > Many times people are pondering what to eat for a meal and end up buying take-out or fast food after they can't decide for too long.

## Solution ##
  > This helps address the age old question of "what should I eat tonight for dinner". Although the suggestions may not all be of the user's preference, it will give an idea of what they might want to eat or at least what they DON'T want to eat to help eliminate some options.

## Quote from You ##
  > "We want to SENDHALP to everyone who has trouble deciding what food to make"

## How to Get Started ##
  > To get started, simply visit the home page and review the suggested meal or beverage. You can simply save or skip the current suggestion to get a new suggestion.

## Customer Quote ##
  > "I used to never be able to decide what there is to make for dinner. Now, I get a huge variety of poor suggestions so I know what I don't want to eat! I can then switch to the beverage suggestion page and drink my night away"

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > After going through the suggestions, try cooking up one of the meals yourself! If you have suggestions for meals that you would like to share with others, submit them through our form!
